Welcome!

# C basic datatype library
This repository contains a bunch of libraries of datatypes I usually make use of when working with stuffs.
The motivation came from me having to rewrite the exact same code all the time, so I thought I might as well just keep it as a library

# Future plans
- Use some advanced pointer stuffs to allow this to work for any datatype
- Complete the to be done stuffs, and make everything more complete
- Fix bugs (if found any)
- ~~Add a make file~~
